Glow-Up is a new project I am slowly working on in my spare time. This project stemmed from my desire to create and stick to some kind of routine and motivation to better myself. This project has a broad scope, but is currently in the process of developing a CRUD framework for keeping a daily routine based on the average work week. 

I will be expanding on this site and am looking at recreating this site using React Native in the future.
